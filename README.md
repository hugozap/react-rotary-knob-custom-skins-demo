# Custom skins demo for react-rotary-knob

[Demo](https://hugozap.github.io/react-rotary-knob-custom-skins-demo/)

This repository contains 2 custom skins
for demostration purposes. The skin system
used by [react-rotary-knob](https://github.com/hugozap/react-rotary-knob)
allows using different SVG base images and the ability
to update elements based on current value. ( thanks to [react-svgmt](https://github.com/hugozap/react-svgmt))

1) /skins/morph-path.js: Use the `flubber` library to morph a path based on current knob value

2) /skins/transition1.js: Use simple opacity transition
